    <h1>Registering Samples</h1>

    <ol class="rounded">
        <li>Create Shipment</li>
        <li>Create Protein</li>
        <li>Register Samples</li>
    </ol>

    <p>To register samples, it is first necessary to create a new shipment. Please see the other tutorials for instructions on how to do this.</p>

    <p>Once a Shipment has been created click the &quot;Add Container&quot; button on a dewar in the shipment</p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="Add Container" src="/assets/images/doc/samples/add_container.png" /></p>

    <p>This will take you to the register container page. Here you can register samples for this puck.</p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="Add Container Form" src="/assets/images/doc/samples/add_container_form.png" /></p>

    <p>Firstly you need to give the new puck a name. After that each sample needs to be given a protein acronym and sample name as a minimum. Barcode and spacegroup can also be specified if needed. The "+" icon can be used to clone a sample in a similar mannar to the GDA client.</p>

    <p>When a protein acronym and sample name has been specified ISPyB considers the sample to be valid and shows this as a green circle in the puck graphic. You can navigate to a particular sample position by clicking on the puck graphic</p>

    <p>If you need to add a new protein acronym, simply type into the protein acronym box and press Tab</p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="New Protein" src="/assets/images/doc/samples/add_protein.png" /></p>

    <p>You will be prompted to confirm the new protein addition</p>

    <p class="inset"><img class="match" alt="Confirm New Protein" src="/assets/images/doc/samples/add_protein_popup.png" /></p>

    <p>Click "Ok" and the new protein will be created</p>

    <p>Finally to save your new puck click &quot;Add Container&quot; at the bottom of the page</p>

    <h1>Using the old ISPyB Excel Spreadsheet</h1>

    <p>Although not recommended, ISPyB2 supports the old style Excel Spreadsheet. First fill in the spreadsheet as you would usually.</p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="Populated Spreadsheet" src="/assets/images/doc/samples/spreadsheet.png" /></p>

    <p>Now select the current spreadsheet using CTRL-A (CMD-A on Mac) to select the spreadsheet. Depending on your location in the sheet you may need to press this twice.</p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="Selected Spreadsheet" src="/assets/images/doc/samples/spreadsheet_selected.png" /></p>

    <p>Now press CTRL-C (CMD-C on Mac) to copy the contents of the selection to the clipboard. Now go back to ISPyB2 and click the "Paste from Spreadsheet" button<p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="Paste from Spreadsheet" src="/assets/images/doc/samples/paste_spreadsheet.png" /></p>

    <p>This will show a popup. In this popup press CTRL-V (CMD-V on Mac) to paste the contents of the clipboard, then click "Insert"</p>

    <p class="inset"><img class="match" alt="Popup Pasted" src="/assets/images/doc/samples/paste_spreadsheet_popup_pasted.png" /></p>

    <p>The copied samples will now be inserted into the current puck</p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="Pasted Samples" src="/assets/images/doc/samples/pasted_samples.png" /></p>
