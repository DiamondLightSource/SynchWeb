    <h2>Create Lab Contact</h2>
    <p>To create a new shipment, it is necessary to designate a Lab Contact. This person will be our first point of contact regarding matters related to your shipments. ISPyB allows you to easily register different lab contact profiles. See the Lab Contact tutorial for how to register a new Lab Contact</p>

    <h2>Create Shipment</h2>
    <p>Once a Lab Contact has been registered select the "Shipment" page from the proposal menu</p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="Shipment Select" src="/assets/images/doc/shipment/select_shipment.png" /></p>

    <p>This will take you to the shipments page, which lists all shipments for the currently selected proposal. From this page click the &quot;Add Shipment&quot; button on the top right hand side to register a new shipment</p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="Add Shipment" src="/assets/images/doc/shipment/add_shipment.png" /></p>

    <p>This will take you to the "Add Shipment" form. Here you can enter your unique Diamond Dewar ID for each dewar in the shipment. For more information about Diamond Dewar IDs see <a href="http://diamond.ac.uk/Beamlines/Mx/Common/Common-Manual/Shipping-Samples/DewarRegistration.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="Add Shipment Form" src="/assets/images/doc/shipment/add_shipment_form_2019.png" /></p>
    <p>Although it is not compulsory, we strongly encourage you to provide the information about your courier company at this stage. As you are planning to send your dewar to Diamond, you probably have this information available.</p>

    <h2>Updated Process For New Shipments</h2>
    <p>From April 2019, only registered dewars can be added to a shipment in SynchWeb</p>
    <p>A drop down box lists the dewars that are available to a proposal</p>
    <p>If no dewars are available, you will need to either register a new dewar or migrate a dewar to the current proposal</p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="Add Shipment Highlight" src="/assets/images/doc/shipment/add_shipment_form_highlight.png" /></p>

    <h2>Register New Dewar</h2>
    <p>The register link on the add shipment form takes you to the registered dewars list</p>
    <p>From here click on "Register Dewar" button to create a new entry</p>
    <p class="inset"><img alt="Registered Dewar List" src="/assets/images/doc/shipment/registered_dewars_list.png" /></p>

    <p>Fill in the form with a valid facility code and purchase date</p>
    <p class="inset"><img alt="Validate new Dewar" src="/assets/images/doc/shipment/register_dewar_form_complete.png" /></p>

    <p>The form will prevent facility codes that have been previoiusly registered </p>
    <p class="inset"><img alt="Register new Dewar" src="/assets/images/doc/shipment/register_new_dewar_validation.png" /></p>

    <p>Once the form is submitted go back to the shipment page and the dewar should be available in the drop down list</p>

    <h2>Migrate Dewar</h2>
    <p><b>Please make sure that your Lab Contact information is up to date before trying to migrate dewars or lab contacts</b></p>
    <p>The Lab Contact address should be three lines maximum and not include city, post code or country values (there are specific fields for this information).</p>
    <p>Editing an existing Lab Contact entry will guide you through correcting and updating your contact details</p>

    <p>To reuse a dewar from an old proposal, <b>first select the old proposal in SynchWeb</b></p>
    <p>Then select the "Migrate" menu option under the proposal menu</p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="Migrate Dewar Menu" src="/assets/images/doc/shipment/migrate_menu_option.png" /></p>

    <p>This will take you to the "Migrate" form where you can migrate dewars and lab contacts to your current/new proposal</p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="Migrate Dewar" src="/assets/images/doc/shipment/migrate_dewar.png" /></p>

    <p>Enter the new proposal number in the input (the field will auto complete)</p>
    <p>Once the new proposal is found, you can copy lab contacts and select dewars to migrate (make available) in the new proposal</p>
    <p>Once finished, navigate back to the shipment page and the dewars will be available for selection</p>


    <h2>View Shipment</h2>
    <p>Once you have clicked "Add Shipment" at the bottom of the Add Shipment form, your shipment will be created and you can view the shipment information</p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="View Shipment" src="/assets/images/doc/shipment/view_shipment.png" /></p>

    <p>To obtain the shipment labels, click the "Print Shipment Labels" from the shipment page</p>

    <p class="inset"><img alt="Print Labels" src="/assets/images/doc/shipment/print_labels.png" /></p>

    <p>Please stick the outward label (page 2) to the side of your dry shipper and include the return-bound label (page 3) within the dry shipper, especially if you are planning a remote access visit.</p>
