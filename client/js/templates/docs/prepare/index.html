    <h1>Prepare Experiment - Assign Containers</h1>

    <p>Before preparing your experiment you first need to have created a shipment and registered your samples. Please see previous tutorials for instructions on how to do this.</p>

    <p>To prepare your experiment, your pucks need to be loaded in to the robot dewar. You will need the puck position locations ready for the next step. </p>

    <p>First select the &quot;Prepare Experiment&quot; page from the proposal menu</p>

    <p>Then you need to select the visit for which you want to assign containers</p>

    <p>You will then be presented with the sample changer for the beamline for the selected visit along with all of your dewars and their associated containers</p>

    <p>Containers can easily be assigned to sample changer positions by simply dragging the container to a position on the sample changer</p>

    <p>You will then be asked to confirm the assignment</p>

    <p>The container is then assigned to the position in the sample changer, and the dewar is marked as active. This is shown by the green background</p>

    <p>Finally the data in GDA needs to be refreshed. Click &quot;Refresh&quot; in the GDA client and your assignments from ISPyB2 should be pulled into the GDA client</p>
