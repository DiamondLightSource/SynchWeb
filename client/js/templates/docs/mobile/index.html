    <h1>Mobile Access</h1>

    <p>SynchWeb is optimised for use on mobile devices, working with both tablet and phone sized devices. The navigation menu is organised in such a way to make it easier to use on small displays.</p>

    <p>As such it is possible to use almost all of the existing functionality on a mobile device. This includes things like registering shipments, and samples, as well as following data collections</p>
