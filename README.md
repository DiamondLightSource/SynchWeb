# SynchWeb
SynchWeb is an ISPyB web application which consists of a PHP REST API and a Backbone/Marionette javascript client.
The client includes some newer components written in Vue.js

## Installation
Running SynchWeb requires setting up a Linux, Apache, MariaDB and PHP (LAMP) software stack. If running in production you should configure your Apache and PHP to serve secure pages only. The steps below describe how to build the software so it is ready to deploy onto your target server.

For development, a simple environment can be setup by using scripts provided [here](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/synchweb-devel-env). They are not intended for production use but include scripts to automatically build and deploy the software on a local VM.

### Requirements
To build SynchWeb on a machine you will need [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/) and [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

You will also need php5 on the build machine.

If not using the development VMs you will also need an instance of the ISPyB database [here](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/ispyb-database)

### Check out the code
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/SynchWeb
```
### Customise front end - config.json
An example configuration is provided in client/src/js/config_sample.json
This file should be edited to customise the application for your site

| Parameter | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| apiurl | Base API root path of back end services e.g. /api |
| appurl | Base API root path of client app, normally not required ""|
| production | deprecated with webpack build |
| build | git hash of current build, used if dynamic reload of pages required post deployment|
| pucks | Array that lists default number of puck positions in sample changers for beamlines |
| valid_samples | Boolean that if true, prevents using any sample that has not come from a User Office (i.e. protein with an externalId) |
| gsMajorAxisOrientation | Determines whether the major grid scan axis determines the orientation of the view |
| maintenance_message | Can be used so app serves static page under maintenance periods |
| maintenance | Flag to indicate if client is in maintenance mode|
| ga_ident | Google Analytics id|
| site_name | Site Name to display in footer |
| site_link | URL to site home page |
| site_image | PNG image of site logo to display in header|

### Build front end
See package.json for the full list of commands that can be run.

```sh
$ cd SynchWeb/client
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

### Customise back end - config.php
An example configuration is provided in api/config_sample.php
Main items to change include:
- database connection parameters (user, password, host, port)
- authentication type (cas, ldap, dummy/no authentication)


### Build backend end
```sh
$ cd SynchWeb/api
$ composer install
```

### Developing the client application
It is possible to run the client code on a local machine and connect to an existing SynchWeb installation on a server.
The steps required are to build the front end code and then run a webpack dev server to host the client code.
```sh
$ cd SynchWeb/client
$ npm run build:dev
$ npm run serve -- --env.port=8080 --env.proxy.target=http://192.168.33.10
```
In this example a browser pointed at localhost:8080 will connect to a SynchWeb back end on 192.168.33.10. Don't ignore the middle '--' otherwise the dev server will not receive the arguments!

The command line options available are described in this table. These override the defaults set in webpack.config.js.

| Parameter | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| env.port | Webpack dev server port |
| env.proxy.target | Full address of the SynchWeb PHP backend server (can include port if required) |
| env.proxy.secure | Flag to set if connecting to an https address for the SynchWeb backend |
